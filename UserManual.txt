Setup and Compilation
1. Download and unzip the submission from eLearning on a Linux box in the multi-platform lab.
2. The submission includes:
	-BruteForce.cpp/hpp
	-CityWeight.cpp/hpp
	-FileReader.cpp/hpp
	-Makefile
	-MutationRemastered.cpp/hpp
	-UI.cpp/hpp
	-distances.txt
	-main.cpp
	-UserManual.txt (this file)
	-WashingtonA_ResultsTable.xcl
	-WashingtonA_Project3_UML.pdf

3. Environment: This program has been tested in the multi-platform lab and will run there.

4.Compiling. This program includes a Makefile.At the command line in Linux, type make main.

Running the program: Make sure that "distances.txt" is within the folder and in the same folder with the executable ./main

User input: User interaction within asking for amount of cities, tours, generations, and percentage number of mutations to mutate.

Output: All output goes to the console. Output will be similar to this: 

Please enter amount of cities: 
Please enter amount of tours: 
Please enter amount of generations: 
Please enter percentage number of the number of mutations: 

Number of cities: 
Brute force optimal cost: 
Time taken for brute force: 
Cost from GA elite one: 
Cost from GA elite two: 
Genetic Algorithim Time: 
Percentage of optimal produced by GA elite one: 
Percentage of optimal produced by GA elite two:
